Problem Statement
Music Discovery with a Personal Touch
In today's world, music is an integral part of our lives, and finding the perfect song to suit our emotions can be challenging. Moodify aims to solve this by:

Recommending songs based on facial expression and detected emotion.
Allowing users to search for music by artist or specific song.
Project Overview
1. Emotion-Based Music Recommendation
Using facial recognition, Moodify detects the user's emotional state (happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.) and recommends songs that resonate with their mood.

2. Artist or Song-Based Music Search
Users can type the name of an artist or song and receive a curated list of music recommendations directly from Spotify.
